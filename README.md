# provanna-morphology

This repository holds the raw morphological data used to characterize intra- and inter-specific morphological variation in the manuscript "New records of Provanna (Mollusca, Gastropoda) from the Costa Rica Margin and an identification key for the genus." All measurements are given in milimeters except for Basal Spirals, which were counted.
